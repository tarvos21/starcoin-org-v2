Starcoin is about to release its mainnet, which will attract a
lot of attention in the industry.
First, I would like to ask Mr. Tim to briefly introduce the Starcoin project and vision. Compared with other
public chains, how should we understand this vision?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Starcoin is a blockchain project that is structured in a layered manner and designed for distributed
finance. Starcoin is inspired by Libra released by Facebook in 2019.
The goal is to establish a set of financial infrastructure that simply serves ordinary users, and uses its
smart contract language Move, which is specifically designed for distributed financial networks and digital
assets,
to realize an open permissionless public chain. Starcoin is the industry's first public chain project to
support the Move ecology.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Starcoin inherits Bitcoin's excellent security mechanism, and provides high transaction throughput
capabilities by improving the PoW algorithm and introducing a multi-layer network.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">From the perspective of ordinary users, an issue of great concern is asset security. I believe you have
heard more or less reports of asset security vulnerabilities.
How to make assets more secure and make users more at ease is a question worth thinking about. The Starcoin
community has done a lot of in-depth research from this perspective.
We have noticed that a large part of the vulnerabilities are caused by very low-level errors, such as
vulnerabilities like unlimited issuance. If you improve from the smart contract language level, it can be
greatly reduced.
This security risk. Based on this consideration, Starcoin decided to use the more secure Move language as
the smart contract language to better serve users and escort DeFi.</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">2. What milestones did Starcoin experience from the project launch
to the mainnet launch? What are the plans for the next step?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">The Starcoin community was established in the second half of 2018. By the end of 2018, version 1.0 of the
Starcoin white paper was officially released;<br>After 1 year of unremitting efforts, at the end of 2019, the Stargate prototype was successfully realized,
and it was officially announced to use Move as a smart contract language to jointly develop the Move ecology
with Libra.<br>The Starcoin v0.1 version released on April 9, 2020, launches the Halley test network;<br>The Starcoin v0.4 version released on August 6, 2020, launched the Proxima test network;<br>The Starcoin block explorer will be launched on February 6, 2021;<br>Release Starcoin v1.0.0.beta on March 27, 2021, and launch the Barnard test network;</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">What I mentioned earlier is the history and milestones of Starcoin. Of course, the most important thing is
the upcoming mainnet launch event to be held on May 15, 2021, and the official launch of the mainnet around
May 18. Welcome everyone to watch the live broadcast this Saturday afternoon.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">The launch of the mainnet is only the starting point for Starcoin. After that, the Starcoin community will
focus on two directions:<br>1). Build and improve the DeFi ecosystem;<br>2) Create the second layer of Starcoin;<br>At that time, Starcoin is not only a public chain, it will be a very competitive ecology, so stay tuned!</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">3. The title of the Starcoin launch event is the new generation of
Libra open public chain. How do you interpret this sentence? What is the relationship between Starcoin and
Libra?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">First of all, Libra is actually a PoS chain composed of 27 alliance nodes. It uses a BFT consensus
algorithm. Other nodes can only act as verification and cannot participate in consensus. The threshold for
alliance members is very high, and ordinary institutions have no chance. participate. Moreover, Libra is
designed to anchor a basket of legal currency stable currency systems. Ordinary developers cannot fully
utilize the capabilities of the Libra platform, so Libra is not an open blockchain project.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Starcoin is an independent blockchain project that adopts PoW consensus. All nodes compete fairly and reach
a consensus, so it is a completely open blockchain network. Secondly, Starcoin is a completely open network,
and everyone can participate, such as deploying contracts, creating digital assets, and developing DeFi
applications; while Libra is a semi-open network, and ordinary users can only use the services provided by
Libra; therefore, Starcoin is more It can represent the new generation of Libra open public chain.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">In addition, in terms of supported features, Starcoin includes many features that Libra does not have. Here
are a few examples:<br>1). On-chain governance;<br>2). Status billing;<br>3). Everyone can deploy their own contract;<br>To sum up, both Starcoin and Libra use the same Move system, while Starcoin has richer features and a more
open ecosystem.</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">4. The Starcoin consensus is an enhancement of the Satoshi Nakamoto
consensus. Compared with the consensus of Bitcoin and Ethereum, what are the main enhancements?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Let's discuss the PoW consensus first. First, PoW must reach the consensus of the entire network. Network
delay cannot be avoided, and the delay changes in real time. Secondly, from the user's point of view, they
very much hope that their transactions can be quickly connected to the chain. This is a dilemma in the PoW
consensus and cannot be completely resolved. In view of this, the Starcoin community is trying to find a
suitable balance between these two issues.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Next, let's get a macro experience of Starcoin's consensus through a picture.</div><img src=https://uploader.shimo.im/f/6ZW4rUGXb4lecDFt.png!thumbnail><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">First look at the upper part of the picture. This is an example of the block situation in a period of time.
In particular, the green circle in the picture indicates the uncle block.
Look again, there are 3 dashed red boxes at the bottom of this picture, which actually represent 3 Epochs.
So, how do you understand Epoch? What are the benefits of such a design?
Earlier we talked about the difficulties of PoW consensus. The Starcoin community hopes that on the basis of
PoW, the bandwidth of the entire network can be more fully utilized.
In other words, Starcoin must produce blocks as quickly as possible when the entire network quickly reaches
a consensus, so that transactions can be chained faster.
However, due to the delay in the network, the faster the block is produced, the higher the probability of
uncle blocks will be, and there will be more uncle blocks,
which will further aggravate network congestion and delay. This situation is more complicated in scenarios
where computing power fluctuates or the network changes dynamically.
Based on the above considerations, the Starcoin community hopes that the Starcoin consensus can adaptively
calculate and adjust the block generation time based on the current network delay, so as to make full use of
network bandwidth.
In essence, it is to dynamically find a balance between the block time and the uncle block rate.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Therefore, the Starcoin consensus perceives the current congestion situation of the network by counting the
uncle block rate of each Epoch. If, in the last period of time, that is, the last Epoch, the uncle block of
the main chain has increased, and the uncle block rate has reached a threshold,
it can be understood that the network is congested. At this time, the difficulty of mining should be
increased and the rate of block generation should be slowed. , Thereby reducing the burden on the network.
Conversely, if the network is in good condition, the network delay is small, and the new block can quickly
reach a consensus,
the uncle block rate of the previous Epoch will be small. This situation can reduce the difficulty of block
generation, accelerate the block generation speed, and make transactions more efficient. Get on the chain
fast.
In this way, the Starcoin consensus can dynamically adjust the block generation speed by sensing network
congestion. This is the benefit of designing Epoch. Since consensus introduces uncle blocks, it faces a new
problem: uncle block rewards.
First of all, the consensus must encourage miners to pack uncle blocks so that the uncle block rate can be
counted; at the same time, it is necessary to avoid malicious nodes to dig uncle blocks specifically,
resulting in a large difference between the uncle block rate and the real situation.
Therefore, the Starcoin consensus does not give any rewards to uncle blocks, but a certain reward to miners
who pack uncle blocks. Regarding this reward, let me just say that in order to ensure the constant issuance
of Starcoin, the uncle block reward is also dynamically changing. There is a special calculation algorithm,
and interested friends can go and learn more.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">To sum up, the Starcoin consensus has made many improvements on the basis of the Nakamoto consensus.
Compared with the consensus of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the main differences are as follows:<br>1) According to Epoch's statistics of uncle block rate, dynamically adjust the difficulty of block
generation, and balance "network delay" and "block generation time";<br>2) Compared with Ethereum, the total amount of Starcoin rewards is constant;<br>3) There is no reward for uncle block, but uncle block reward is packaged;<br>Of course, there are some other optimizations, which will not be discussed here.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">5. Smart contracts are more prone to security issues, and currently
rely on security audits to check, what security considerations does Starcoin have in terms of smart contract
language?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">This problem is very good. The Starcoin community has conducted an in-depth analysis of the contract layer
security vulnerabilities that appeared in the history of the blockchain. There are many reasons for the
vulnerabilities, and a large part of them are caused by low-level errors. This is also the final decision of
Starcoin to use Move as a smart The main reason for the contract. There are many advantages of the Move
language. Here is a simple example:<br>In Ethereum, the transfer operation can be simplified to an addition and subtraction operation. Assets are
subtracted from one account and added to another account. In this seemingly simple process, two abnormal
situations may occur, which may lead to serious security vulnerabilities.<br>Case 1: Assets are subtracted from one account and not added to another account. This situation will cause
the assets to disappear out of thin air;<br>The second situation is more serious: assets are added to one account, but the other account is not reduced,
which will lead to unlimited issuance.<br>This is how many real security vulnerabilities have emerged in history. This problem can be easily avoided
in the Move language.<br>Move has keywords such as copy, drop, store, key, etc. You only need to not add the copy and drop keywords
when defining the asset. In this way, the asset can only be moved from one account and added to another
account, and it cannot be discarded. Nor can it be modified. It is very easy and perfect to avoid the above
two abnormal situations.<br>Of course, the Move language has more security advantages, such as supporting formal verification, not
providing dynamic calls, etc. Interested friends can find out.<br>It can be said that the Move language is a smart contract language tailored for digital assets.</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">6. Is the account model of Starcoin similar to the UTXO model of
Bitcoin? Or is it Ethereum's Account model?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">The account model of Starcoin is the Account model, but it is very different from that of Ethereum.<br>Ethereum divides accounts into contract accounts and user accounts. The contract account not only stores the
code of the contract, but also stores the status of all accounts in the contract. The advantage of this
design is that the read and write permissions are completely controlled by the contract, and the degree of
freedom is high; the disadvantage is that the ownership of the state data is not clear, which is easy to
bring security risks, and the problem of "state explosion" may also occur.<br>Based on the above considerations, Starcoin has improved the account model:<br>1). There is only one account. Any account can deploy a smart contract, and the contract code is stored in
the code area of the current account.<br>2) The state data of the same contract is stored in the data area of the user's respective account in a
decentralized manner, so that the ownership of the state data is clarified, which not only enhances the
security of the user state, but also provides the possibility for state billing.<br>It can be said that Starcoin's Account model is a bright spot;</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">7. Contract upgrade is a problem that the community is very
concerned about. The EVM ecosystem usually upgrades the contract through Proxy. Does Starcoin have a more
elegant upgrade plan?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">I will split this question into two questions to introduce:<br>First of all, how does Starcoin upgrade the contract? Regarding this issue, on the one hand, the Starcoin
community believes that the contract upgrade is very necessary, such as a serious security breach; on the
other hand, the contract cannot be changed at will. Therefore, the Starcoin community upgrades the contract
by combining it with on-chain governance.<br>The second question is also the upgrade contract. What is the difference between the Starcoin and the
Ethereum model?<br>In the Ethereum model, calling a contract is actually a process of finding the contract code through the
contract address. The contract address here can be understood as the hash of the contract code. It is easy
for people who know the technology to understand, once the code is changed, the hash will change.
The result of this design means that once the contract is deployed, even if there is a security breach, it
cannot be changed. Therefore, the Ethereum upgrade contract is actually the deployment of a new contract.
Usually a Proxy contract is set in front of the contract to store the address of the real contract. Once the
new contract is deployed, the contract address stored by the Proxy must reach the new contract address. This
is the principle of the Ethereum upgrade contract.<br>In the Starcoin model, the code is stored in the code area of the user account where the contract is
deployed. The calling contract is retrieved through the address of the account and the storage path path of
the contract in the account, so in principle, as long as the address and path remain unchanged, a new
contract is used. Code, overwriting the old contract code is no problem. What is particularly stated here is
that it does not mean that Starcoin's contracts can be upgraded at will, but that Starcoin's built-in
on-chain governance requires the consent of most people to upgrade.<br>Therefore, Starcoin's model not only solves the problem caused by the inability to upgrade the contract, but
also avoids users from upgrading the contract casually.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">8. How is the community governance of Starcoin planned?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">The Starcoin community is completely decentralized, and everyone can participate in fair and open governance
through voting.<br>First of all, Starcoin has implemented a mature and complete on-chain governance process;<br>Secondly, the governance of the Starcoin public chain itself is also governed through the chain. Anyone can
initiate new proposals and vote on the chain. New proposals can only be implemented if they are voted
on;<br>Therefore, the complete on-chain governance capability is a very big highlight of Starcoin.</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">9. Is Starcoin a constant issuance? What is the total amount? What
is the block reward for miners?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">There should be many friends who are concerned about this issue. The total circulation of Starcoin is
constant, the total amount is 3,185,136,000. The block rewards for miners are calculated by algorithms. The
details of the algorithm are not discussed here. Those who are interested can take a look at the economic
model SIP on the Starcoin website. So about the block reward, you can simply understand it as an average of
1 STC per second.</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">10. What kind of mining algorithm is Starcoin? Can CPU and graphics
card mine?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Starcoin uses a variant of the cryptonight algorithm, a CPU-friendly algorithm. You can also dig through the
graphics card.</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">11. Do you support the development of DeFi projects on Starcoin, and
what preparations are required technically?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Move was born for DeFi. The development of DeFi in Starcoin is exactly the same as other public chains
except for the difference in the Move programming language. Move itself is easy to get started. There are
many examples of Move contracts in the Starcoin developer documentation. There are also some discussions in
the Move Chinese community. You can check it out if you are interested. The Starcoin community welcomes
everyone's participation, and there are further ecological support plans.</div><hr><div class="info_title mt20">Jolestar-Chain Catcher AMA</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">1. Chain Catcher: Please briefly introduce the development history
of Starcoin.</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: Starcoin is a blockchain project that is structured in a layered manner and designed for
distributed finance.<br>The Starcoin community was established in the second half of 2018. The team comes from Internet companies
and technical communities. At first, some technical personnel who were interested in blockchain organized a
blockchain learning group and regularly organized blockchain technology sharing.<br>Later, the main members gradually resigned from the Internet company, joined the blockchain industry, and
formed the Starcoin core development team.<br>At the end of 2018, version 1.0 of the Starcoin white paper was officially released. Later, after a year of
exploration, we successively experimented with Layer 2 networks on Lightning Network and Ethereum.<br>At the end of 2019, the Stargate prototype was successfully realized, and it was officially announced to use
Move as a smart contract language to jointly develop the Move ecology with Libra.<br>The Starcoin v0.1 version was released on April 9, 2020, and the Halley test network was launched; the main
network was launched on May 18, 2021.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">2. Chain catcher: The public chain competition is extremely fierce.
Do you think Starcoin chooses to enter the public chain track currently. What are the competitive
advantages?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: In my opinion, the current public chains are not in competition. Because the entire blockchain is
still a small ecology, everyone is not competing for the stock market, but to open up new space
together.<br>It can be seen from the recent development of various public chains, especially the chains in the DeFi
field, that the throughput capacity of all the current public chains is actually far from meeting the needs
of the DeFi market.<br>The new DeFi-oriented chain generally has two directions: one is based on the development of Ethereum EVM,
so that it can quickly take over the flow of Ethereum due to congestion. The advantage of this direction is
that it is fully compatible with Ethereum, the DeFi application switching cost is low, and the tools of the
Ethereum ecosystem can be reused. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to make major improvements and
will basically inherit the existing flaws of Ethereum.<br>The other is based on new technical solutions, such as introducing a new state model and programming
language. The advantage of this direction is that it can make big improvements in the state model and smart
contract layer. The disadvantage is that the surrounding ecology needs to be rebuilt and the cycle is
relatively long.<br>Both directions have their own advantages and disadvantages. We choose the second direction, which is a
long-term route that is more suitable for our team.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">3. Chain catcher: The smart contract programming language of
Starcoin is Move, why do we need a new programming language?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: This question is actually two questions. Why do smart contracts on the blockchain need a new
programming language? And why not use the existing smart contract programming language.<br>To answer the first question first, there are two main differences between smart contract programming
languages and traditional programming languages:<br>The link controls the state of the smart contract program. The state of traditional programming languages
requires developers to write it into a database or file for maintenance. Smart contracts simplify state
hosting and abstract an expression of external state.<br>The link controls the scheduling of the smart contract program. There is no need to consider issues such as
concurrent scheduling in smart contracts. In traditional programming languages, there are mechanisms such as
threads, coroutines, and locks to solve concurrency problems.<br>In other words, traditional programming languages are abstractions provided by operating systems, whether it
is files, networks, or scheduling.<br>When these concepts are not considered, most of the existing programming language libraries are actually
unavailable, and there is no advantage in reusing existing programming languages, but it only increases
compatibility costs.<br>Now to answer the second question, why not use existing smart contract programming languages, such as
Solidity?<br>As we said earlier, the smart contract escrows the state of the program. As for how the external state is
expressed in the contract, there is not yet a unified system standard similar to the operating system.<br>If you want to transform the state model, you definitely need to change the smart contract programming
language. In order to try a new state model, we need to use a new programming language to express it.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">4. Chain Catcher: What are the characteristics and advantages of
Move's development language?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: The key reason we chose Move is that its state model closely matches our design.<br>First, it splits the state of the contract under the account, instead of all escrow in the contract,
clarifying the ownership of the state.<br>Secondly, on this basis, it uses a linear type mechanism to track ownership, guarantees the security of
assets (not implicitly discarded), and also provides a more flexible asset programming model.<br>The safe and flexible asset programming model uses my previous PPT to illustrate:<br><img src=https://uploader.shimo.im/f/7LlgAPpqeBVjA1bN.png!thumbnail>
The first level of asset resource abstraction, all assets and tokens are equivalent, STC and other tokens
are the same in terms of security level.<br>Through data abstraction, instead of interfaces, there is no dynamic distribution mechanism.<br>Protect resources through programming language features such as data visibility and ability (drop, store),
and make full use of the features and capabilities of programming language compile-time checking.<br>As in the above example, solidity's contract is a bookkeeping model, and everyone's assets are recorded in
the contract's ledger, while Move is a box model, and the assets are packed in a box composed of objects.
But the more subtle differences can only be felt by writing the code directly.</div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">5. Chain catcher: I heard that there are not many developers who
understand the Move language in China. Will this have a negative impact on your application ecology?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: Move is a new language and has learning costs. There are really not many developers.<br>But the blockchain is still very early, and smart contract developers are still a very small group compared
to the Internet developer community.<br>I believe that there will be a large number of Internet developers entering the field of blockchain smart
contracts in the future. At that time, for them, all smart contract languages are new languages and have
learning costs, so the difference is not very big.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">6. Chain catcher: How do you see the importance of DeFi ecology to
the public chain? How will Starcoin build a DeFi ecosystem next?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: DeFi is one of the most suitable DApp types for public chains. Before Layer 2 is not yet mature,
the applications that can run on Layer 1 are mainly DeFi. At the beginning of the design, we were oriented
towards financial scenarios, which is similar to Libra.<br>The DeFi ecosystem needs to be jointly built by the core developers of the chain and DApp developers. The
infrastructure of the public chain, including wallets, block explorers, and development tools, our core
developers will mainly focus on this field.<br>A large part of our economic model is reserved for ecology, which will be distributed through ecological
applications through on-chain governance, not just through miners.<br>We believe that DApp ecology is very important for DeFi public chains. As the upper application ecology
grows, miners can also get more benefits.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">7. Chain catcher: NFT has been very popular some time ago, and it is
a concept that is easy to get out of the circle. Does Starcoin support NFT?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: Move's resource model is very suitable for expressing NFT. It is very similar to Flow's Cadence
contract language. Both use linear types to track ownership. (Flow is a public chain dedicated to
NFT).<br>The NFT standard on Starcoin has not yet been published. We are working with community developers to deduce
the NFT standard on Move.<br>In addition, Starcoin will support any Token as a gas fee, which will reduce the cost of accepting
blockchain and DApp for users outside the NFT circle.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">8. Chain catcher: What value and application scenarios does
Starcoin's native token STC have in the public chain ecosystem?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: STC is the native token on Starcoin. The main scenarios are:<br>1. Pay the gas cost of the transaction, which is the same as most public chains.<br>2. As the governance currency for on-chain governance, one currency, one vote.<br>It can be said that Starcoin is one of the public chains with the most thorough implementation of on-chain
governance. Anyone can initiate improvement proposals and implement them through community-based
voting.<br>There are mainly the following governance options:<br>1. Adjustment of key parameters on the chain, such as block rewards.<br>2. The upgrade of Stdlib, Stdlib contains the core consensus logic and economic model.<br>3. Apply for withdrawal from the national treasury for ecological development.<br></div><hr><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">9. Chain catcher: Many people are opposed to on-chain governance.
They feel that voting governance will introduce too much political atmosphere and cause the community to be
not pure enough. How is the introduction of on-chain governance in Starcoin considered?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: In fact, whether there is on-chain governance or not, a mechanism is needed to resolve the
differences in the community.<br>Governance models such as Bitcoin's BIP and Ethereum's EIP are basically off-chain governance models. The
general process is to put forward proposals, discuss in the community, develop and release versions by core
developers, and miners upgrade nodes, and the code agrees to automatically activate new features at a
certain height.<br>In most cases, this governance model also works well, but once developers and miners in the community have
irreconcilable differences between a certain feature, the chain and the community will face the risk of hard
forks, such as DAO attacks. That fork, and the most recent EIP1559.<br>Looking at the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, it can be found that there are two biggest
dilemmas faced by community governance:<br>1. There is no clear indicator to determine which proposition has reached a majority consensus in the
community.<br>2. The agreement negotiated off-chain is not binding on the chain.<br>Therefore, we try to implement on-chain governance in Starcoin and try to solve the above two dilemmas to a
certain extent.<br>First of all, no matter how the governance mechanism is designed, voting will eventually produce a clear
result and convey a clear message to the community.<br>Secondly, on-chain governance delays the time point of decision-making. Developers and miners can perform
their professional responsibilities first, only to evaluate the feasibility of the proposal from a technical
point of view, develop and upgrade the node, and then decide with community members whether to activate and
When to activate new features.<br>Finally, once the voting results on the chain are generated, since the nodes have actually been upgraded,
the final voting results will be automatically executed on the chain and are binding.<br>We put forward the design principle of the governance mechanism: "Technology creates possibilities, and the
community decides whether to choose."<br>In the development and upgrade phases, developers and miners should maintain a technology-neutral attitude
towards the proposal. When the upgrade is completed and voting is required, they will exercise the right to
choose values as community members and decide whether to choose.<br></div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index20">10. Chain Catcher: What is the next development roadmap for
Starcoin? What is the focus of recent operations?</div><div class="info mt10 padding_text_index54">Jolestar: The focus in the near future is to prepare for the Hackathon Developer Contest. At that time, we
will organize a global developer competition with Facebook's Move community to attract more people's
attention to Move and develop blockchain applications based on Move.</div></div></div><div class="footer visible-lg"><div class=container><div class="row hr"><div class="col-md-4 item">Contact Us</div><div class="col-md-4 item">Technology</div><div class="col-md-4 item">Community</div></div><div class="row td"><div class="col-md-4 item">WeChat Public Account: Starcoin区块链</div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/starmask/mfhbebgoclkghebffdldpobeajmbecfk?hl=zh-CN">StarMask Wallet</a></div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href=https://starcoin.org/en/news/>News</a></div></div><div class="row td"><div class="col-md-4 item">Twitter: <a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/starcoinstc>StarcoinSTC</a></div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href=https://explorer.starcoin.org>Blockchain Explorer</a></div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href=https://westar.io>Westar Labs</a></div></div><div class="row td"><div class="col-md-4 item">Join WeChat Group: starcoinorg</div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href=https://starcoin.org/en/developer/>Developer Docs</a></div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href=https://www.movelang.io>Move Chinese Community</a></div></div><div class="row td"><div class="col-md-4 item">Discord: <a target=_blank href=https://discord.gg/96tKt5exaE>Starcoin Spaceship</a></div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href=https://starcoin.org/en/developer/sdk/>SDK</a></div><div class="col-md-4 item"><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/starcoinorg/starcoin/discussions>GitHub Discussion</a></div></div><div class=foot><div class=copyright>© 2018-2021 Starcoin.org All Rights Reserved.</div></div></div></div><div class="m-footer visible-xs visible-sm visible-md"><div class=container><div class=go-contact-us>Contact Us<img src=/img/r-arrow.png></div><div class=row-li><div class=item>WeChat Public Account: Starcoin区块链</div><div class=item>Join WeChat Group: starcoinorg</div></div><div class=row-li><div class=item>Twitter: <a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/starcoinstc>StarcoinSTC</a></div><div class=item>Discord: <a target=_blank href=https://discord.gg/96tKt5exaE>Starcoin Spaceship</a></div></div><div class=go-contact-us>Technology<img src=/img/r-arrow.png></div><div class=row-li><div class=item><a target=_blank href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/starmask/mfhbebgoclkghebffdldpobeajmbecfk?hl=zh-CN">StarMask Wallet</a></div><div class=item><a target=_blank href=https://explorer.starcoin.org>Blockchain Explorer</a></div></div><div class=row-li><div class=item><a target=_blank href=https://starcoin.org/en/developer/>Developer Docs</a></div><div class=item><a target=_blank href=https://starcoin.org/en/developer/sdk/>SDK</a></div></div><div class=go-contact-us>Community<img src=/img/r-arrow.png></div><div class=row-li><div class=item><a target=_blank href=https://starcoin.org/en/news/>News</a></div><div class=item><a target=_blank href=https://westar.io>Westar Labs</a></div></div><div class=row-li><div class=item><a target=_blank href=https://www.movelang.io>Move Chinese Community</a></div><div class=item><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/starcoinorg/starcoin/discussions>GitHub Discussion</a></div></div><div class=crt>© 2018-2021 Starcoin.org All Rights Reserved.</div></div></div></body></html>
